    		Dear UBA Partner:
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		Welcome to the 2014 Fall Meeting & Expo of United Benefit Advisors (UBA). This meeting promises to deliver the latest insights in the benefits industry and is designed to help you take the complexities out of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) so that you can deliver the best, most knowledgeable service to your clients. Through branding, marketing, compliance, and sales presentations, you’ll be able to strengthen your current strategies and leverage this wisdom to maintain your Firm’s continued growth and success.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		Based on the success and feedback from this year’s Spring meeting, the 2014 UBA Fall Meeting & Expo will again kick off with a welcome reception/cocktail party on Sunday at 6:00 p.m. on the show floor and feature more than 25 exhibitors displaying their latest products and services. You can relax and enjoy an open bar and heavy hors d'oeuvres as you mix and mingle with attendees and fellow colleagues.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		Another highlight of this year’s meeting is the UBApalooza (pronounced you-bah-pa-looza). Join us on Monday at 9:00 p.m. in the Montrose Room at the Loews (formerly InterContinental) Chicago O'Hare for live music featuring the band Odd Man Out with Travis Riker on lead vocals, guitar, and harp. Mr. Riker is “one of our own” and a Benefits Consultant with UBA Partner Firm Arista Consulting Group in Alpharetta, Georgia.

    	<p>
    		The centerpiece this year is keynote speaker Janet Trautwein, CEO of the National Association of Health Underwriters (NAHU) in Washington, D.C.  NAHU represents more than 100,000 employee benefits professionals involved in the design, sale, implementation, and management of health plans all over the United States.  Her responsibilities include oversight of all NAHU activities and primary representation of the association to the media, government agencies, and elected officials at all levels.  During her presentation on Monday at 9:00 a.m., Ms. Trautwein will provide an insider's view of politics inside the Beltway and possible changes due to the mid-term elections.  She will also discuss what Congress is looking at in terms of modifications to PPACA and the chances of those changes becoming reality.  Current and upcoming regulatory events will also be covered with an overview of immediate compliance issues and how your clients should prepare.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		In addition, the meeting will feature updates on Partner success stories with UBA’s private exchange solution, PowerPaks, and several general and focused breakout sessions exploring how you can improve your sales techniques and betters serve your clients. These sessions are ideal for both Principals and staff. You will also have plenty of free time to network with other UBA Partners, Strategic Partners, guest speakers, and more. Don’t forget to reserve dinner Monday evening at one of the numerous area restaurants, where you may socialize and discuss experiences.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		We encourage you to take full advantage of the shared wisdom at the 2014 UBA Fall Meeting & Expo, including the plethora of networking opportunities and planned activities presented over the course of the event. We hope you find these few days at the Loews Chicago O'Hare hotel worthwhile. Our goal is to ensure this event is a vital resource that will help you maximize success now and in the future. Thank you for joining us!
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		Sincerely,
    	</p>
