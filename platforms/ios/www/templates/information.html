    		Dear UBA Partners:
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		Welcome to the 2015 Mid-Winter Meeting &amp; Expo of United Benefit Advisors at the Hyatt Regency Coconut Point Resort &amp; Spa in gorgeous Bonita Springs, Florida. It’s great to go somewhere warm, connect with many Principals, and continue learning from the shared wisdom of our collective organization.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		The theme of our meeting is Legacy, and we will spend considerable time talking about the future of the employee benefits industry, our organization, and your Firms. But we will also invest in discussions about continuing the legacy each UBA Partner Firm wants to leave – from ensuring you are hiring the best talent today, to establishing deep roots (The Bamboo Principle), and to perpetuation and succession planning.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		Based on the success and feedback from past UBA meetings, the 2015 Mid-Winter Meeting &amp; Expo will again have a welcome reception/cocktail party on Sunday at 6:00 p.m. on the show floor. You can relax and network with all the exhibitors displaying their latest products and services.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		As with all UBA meetings, this one promises to deliver the latest insights in the benefits industry and is designed to help you take the complexities out of the ever-changing Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) so that you can deliver the best, most knowledgeable service to your clients. However, this year’s agenda also addresses specific objectives.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		There will be a session on what distinguishes greatness – either corporate or individual – from merely having talent. It’s this sustainable success that enables agencies to rise above their competition and be recognized as the true future leaders in this industry. There are sessions where you’ll learn how to strengthen your business and grow from within so that once you’ve achieved that paramount level of success, you’ll be able to pass the baton with pride to the next generation of leaders. They will carry your legacy with them through the transition so that your agency has a solid foundation on which to continue its expansion.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		All of us at UBA want you and your Firm to thrive and prosper, which is why we encourage you to participate fully and gain as much as possible from the shared knowledge and opportunities that are available – especially the PowerPak sessions, general sessions, and breakouts. Please take advantage of the wealth of information that will be presented by your fellow Principals and VIPs, guest speakers and Strategic Partners.
    	</p>
    	<p>In between all this, there will be ample free time to mingle and share stories with familiar colleagues and new faces. In addition, you may reserve dinner and socialize during the “Dine Arounds” on Monday evening at several area restaurants.
</p>
<p>As I’ve said before, these meetings elevate UBA’s stature in the industry as an organization that continues furnishing leading expertise and support to help our Partners. Our goal is to ensure that these meetings become a crucial part of your plan to succeed in 2015 and beyond.</p>

<p>Even though this will be my second meeting with UBA, I already feel like a seasoned veteran (well, almost) and am personally looking forward to seeing everyone. Thank you for joining us!</p>
    	<p>
    		Sincerely,
    	</p>
    	<p>&nbsp;</p>
    	<p>Les McPhearson, CEO<br>United Benefit Advisors</p>
